# SelfNote

This is a simple php based webpage to take notes in class. I hope to eventually add more formatting options and better note storage options.

## Installation

Installation is pretty straight forward. Get a web host with PHP >= 5.2.0 and that you have access to PDO_SQLITE. Depending on your permissions you will need to create the sqlite db ahead of time as well. Edit config.php before you start so the database is created in the right spot and your username is correct.

## Feature Ideas

Some future features:

 * Update search page. It'd be sweet if this was all done via JavaScript and you could save common views.
 * Clean up the delete setup
 * Add authentication so only you can view your notes, and thus host online. 
 * Sync multiple instances? (use git? yet keep private?)
 * The ability to sort notes on that search page.
 * More stats on the view page. Word/line count? 
 * Better styling, of both the editor and the page. Maybe a quick button that inverses the page?
 * Have "cont" button make more sense. Turn buttons to links maybe?
 * MOAR COWBELL (seriously...)
