SelfNote
========

This is a simple php based webpage to take notes in class. I hope to eventually add more formatting options and better note storage options.

Some future features:
 * A page devoted to searching and sorting old notes. It'd be sweet if this was all done via JavaScript and you could save common views.
 * Better styling, of both the editor and the page. Maybe a quick button that inverses the page?
 * MOAR COWBELL
