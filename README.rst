SelfNote
========

This is a simple php based webpage to take notes in class. I hope to eventually add more formatting options and better note storage options.

Some future features:
 * Update search page. It'd be sweet if this was all done via JavaScript and you could save common views. 
 * The ability to sort notes on that search page.
 * More stats on the view page. Word/line count? 
 * Better styling, of both the editor and the page. Maybe a quick button that inverses the page?
 * MOAR COWBELL (seriously...)
